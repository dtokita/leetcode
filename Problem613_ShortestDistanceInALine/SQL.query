# Write your MySQL query statement below

# Find the minimum value of the difference between the two point
SELECT MIN(Point1.x - Point2.x) AS 'shortest'

# Grab two copies of the tables for comparison
FROM point Point1, point Point2

# Make sure the distance is positive
WHERE Point1.x - Point2.x > 0
